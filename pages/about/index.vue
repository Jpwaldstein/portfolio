      <p>When I first saw The Matrix as a kid, I was blown away. Most kids wanted to be "Neo", the main character with magic powers; But I was always fascinated by the work of "Tank" - the computer guy. He could read a bunch of code on a screen and was able to hack into the matrix.</p>
      <p>Later in life, I found my passion for computer programming in Web Development. Today I strive to be a great developer, who stays current with the evolving industry.</p>
